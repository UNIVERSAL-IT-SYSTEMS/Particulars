*A universe made of LOVE.* Okay, that sounded corny. What is it, really? Right now it's a simple simulation of particles spontaneously existing within an expanding universe. Each particle starts with a set speed that does not change, and a particular type with a short lifetime. When a particle's lifetime is over, it ceases to exist.

What will it be? I'm not sure yet, but I plan on making the particles able to interact in interesting ways.
